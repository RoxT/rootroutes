YOU ARE A MUSHROOM

Hover over one of your roots to activate it. Then click to put down a new root.

Use the arrows or wasd to look around. Use e and c to to zoom in and out.

Each new root costs you one sugar. When you run out of sugar, you die
(and respawn nearby, because you're a mushroom).

If you find a tree, it will trade you sugar for nitrogen every turm.

If you find skeletons underground, you will get more nitrogen from them.

Press any key to begin."
